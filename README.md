#Build a page using the [News API] (https://newsapi.org/)

#First page should display `name` of sources under the `gaming` category as links

#Clicking on a link should transition to another page showing articles published by the News Outlets. The articles should show the `author`, `title`, `description` and `url` 

#Clicking on the `url` should lead to the page containing the article

#Use any framework of your choice and submit a Pull Request when you're done

#Preferable but not necessary: After you are done, display your work as a Github Page

#Api key: ** aed9659f383f4b28b6ba9d30a3cb78c0 **

#All the best. Cheers
